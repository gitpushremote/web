        Extremely powerful poem by <a href="https://x.com/CrunchAlias">@CrunchAlias</a>. 
        Please read right to the end - it took my breath away. 

            There once was a girl
            And she liked to climb trees.
            She had dirt in her hair,
            And blood on her knees.
            Had no pink in her cupboard,
            Didn’t like the right toys,
            So they cut off her hair
            And they called her a boy.

            She fell into depression.
            They tried to be kinder;
            To help her fit in:
            Crushed her breasts in a binder.
            But it wasn’t enough
            She felt awkward and weird,
            So they pumped her with drugs
            And they grew her a beard.

            She couldn’t stand dresses,
            She refused to wear bras,
            So they cut off her breasts,
            Celebrated her scars.
            They stripped flesh off her arm
            Made a fat tube of skin,
            Sewed it onto her crotch,
            And said: “Now you’re a him!”

            He looked like a man,
            But squeaky and little,
            His hair falling out,
            And his bones frail and brittle.
            He suffered through menopause,
            Atrophy, bleeding,
            His new penis was limp
            And lacked any feeling.

            His parents agreed,
            He would never give birth,
            So they cut out his ovaries,
            To spite all the TERFs.
            He grew sadder, and sadder,
            But could not find the answer,
            His heartbeat grew weak,
            And the drugs gave him cancer.

            When crying one night,
            His whole head in a whirl,
            His mum asked: “what’s wrong?”
            She said: “Mum, I’m a girl.”
